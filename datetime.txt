I always keep my hardware clocks set to UTC/GMT. This maintains my clocks uniformly without any worries about "Daylight Savings Time". This is important, because when you set the hardware clock from the system clock (kept by the Linux kernel), you need to know if this is the case. To set the hardware clock from the system clock, leaving the hardware clock in UTC, enter the following: 


# hwclock --systohc --utc

rm /etc/localtime
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Iran /etc/localtime

for check
#ls -al|grep localtime
 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      24 Apr 22 10:02 localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/iran


Update from the command line against a time server
You can update the clock manually, without the need of the daemon with ntpdate
ntpdate 129.6.15.28
