error after run with debug mod =   &"warning: GDB: Failed to set controlling terminal: Invalid argument\n"
first install requirment:
1. sudo apt-get install python2.7

2.I also upgraded gdb to latest 7.9: I installed libncurses5-dev package: sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev , which is needed to build gdb.
I downloaded latest gz archive from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb to the temporary folder, and executed the following commands:
tar xvfz gdb-*.gz
cd gdb*
./configure --prefix /usr/local/bin/gdb-python2 --with-python
make
make install
